This posed a challenge in connecting the ESP32C3 because I had to pipe the USB. This was a setting in the Input tab of the VM config.

I was using the SSD1306 OLED which had an IIC address on the back selected with resistor pins, but the OLED had a completely different address of 3C.\nSuccess!\nNext up tomorrow is to set up a wifi connection example\n2023-10-02 Disassembled TronXY S5 3d printer and scavenged parts\nOrdered some motor controllers\nPlan for software/control\nUse ESP32C3 to control both motor and camera via wifi.\nUse Sony QX1 that I have to keep it light and trigger commands via wifi api from the rig controller.\n","permalink":"https://ilidur.github.io/pages/projects-blog/","summary":"Focus stacking rig #projects Brief: Reuse 3D printer components to learn how to make a basic mechatronic system\nMVP: A one axis slide for photography\nRequires:\nControl board\nalu frame\nProgress 2023-10-03 Goal for today was to set up the dev environment for the controller\nThe controller I\u0026rsquo;m using is the Seeed Xiao ESP32C3\nThe dev environment is a linux VM inside UTM VM environment.
